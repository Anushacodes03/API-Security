# OWASP API Security Top 10 - Course Notes

## Introduction to OWASP

### What is OWASP?
- **Full Name**: Open Worldwide Application Security Project
- **Type**: Non-profit organization
- **Purpose**: Produces leading guidance for application security
- **Best Known For**: OWASP Top 10 for Web Applications

### OWASP API Security Top 10

#### History and Evolution
- **2019**: OWASP recognized that APIs have unique threats and risks distinct from web applications
  - Created the first OWASP API Security Top 10
  - Acknowledged APIs deserve their own dedicated security framework

- **2023**: Updated edition released
  - Some items added
  - Some items changed
  - Some items deleted from the 2019 version
  - This course covers the **2023 edition**

## Course Structure

### Approach
Each item in the Top 10 will be broken down into separate submodules covering:
1. **Description** - What the vulnerability/risk is
2. **Real-world Example** - Demonstration of the risk vector
3. **Best Practices** - Guidance and recommendations for prevention

## Real-World API Attacks

### Current Threat Landscape
- **Volume**: Enormous number of successful API attacks, breaches, and exploits occurring
- **Publicity**: Many attacks are becoming publicized incidents
- **Variety**: Multiple threat vectors being exploited

### Common Threat Vectors Observed

The following threat vectors are being seen in real-world API attacks:

1. **Unauthorized Trading**
2. **Account Data Harvesting**
3. **Data Exposure**
4. **Takeovers**
5. **Tampering**
6. **Reputation Risk**
7. **Ransom**
8. **Third Party Exposure**

### Key Insight: Why APIs Are Vulnerable

#### The Defense Gap
Despite organizations employing comprehensive security measures, API attacks continue to succeed:

**Common Security Measures in Place:**
- Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- Source code scanning
- Dynamic testing
- Penetration testing
- Industry best practices

**The Problem:**
Something about API attacks is getting through these traditional defenses. This gap between traditional security controls and API-specific threats is what makes API security uniquely challenging.

## Course Objectives

This course will explore:
- Why traditional security measures aren't fully effective against API attacks
- Specific vulnerabilities outlined in the OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)
- How to identify and mitigate each type of API security risk
- Real-world examples mapped to each OWASP category
- Best practices for securing APIs

## Next Steps

The course will begin with **OWASP API Security Risk #1** and progress through each item in the Top 10, providing detailed analysis and practical guidance.
